-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use MMLogic and different logic gates.
What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
I had a hard time to try to make the circuit look clean but failed to make it COMPLETELY clean.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Probably divide this into more different parts and give more examples.
