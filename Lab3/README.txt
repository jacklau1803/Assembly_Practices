-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processorâ€™s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
0x10010000 and 0x10010020
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Learning how to use MIPS to write a program with printing and reading and looping.
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I had issues to understand my own code after dinner and fix bugs. I set a lot of branch statements wrong, but I fixed them eventually and I feel GOOD.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Maybe try to make it shorter.
Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
with and the nature of your collaboration.
I did it on my own, but youtube gave me some ideas about input output and looping.
