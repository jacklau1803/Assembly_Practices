------------------------- 

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
I have learnt to build a 4-bit adder, how to build a 4-bit register using Flip
Flop.

What was your design approach?
I wrote the code and try to stimulate it with some logical operations.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I had a lot of issues. My design seemed corrected, but it just would not work. It turned out to be a huge burden and even gave me emotional issues. However, my friends suggested me starting early and ask TAs for help. I will try that next time.

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
Maybe making it a little bit more newbie-friendly so most people will have fun doing it and still learn stuff.
